                        <strong>This is Matilda.</strong><br>
                        She loves learning. She does not love "training" — you know, the kind with 87 slides, 
                        three buzzwords per minute, and absolutely no clue how to do the actual thing.
                    </p>

                    <p class="matilda-paragraph">
                        So Matilda staged a quiet rebellion and helped build <strong>TrailForge</strong> — where learning is:

                        <li><strong>Fluff-free.</strong> (We respect your brain cells.)</li>
                    </ul>

                        If you're typing in an access code, congrats — you've joined her movement: 
                        <em>real skills, zero nonsense.</em>
                    </p>

                    <p class="matilda-paragraph">
                        Matilda will be nearby, calm, supportive, and silently judging any course that wastes your time.

                            Access codes are provided by your organization's training administrator. 
                            If you're part of a company using TrailForge, check with your manager or HR team. 
                            Each code is single-use and links you to the right courses.

                            When you're logged in with an access code, TrailForge automatically tracks your progress.

                            Your progress syncs across devices — start on your laptop, finish on your phone.

                        <p class="faq-answer">
                            Matilda is a cow who believes learning should be practical, not painful. 
                            She's not a real cow (obviously), but she represents our philosophy: 
                            respect people's time, teach real skills, skip the corporate fluff. 
                            She may or may not judge courses that include the phrase "synergy."
