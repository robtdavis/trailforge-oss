### Practical learning on Salesforce — introduced by Matilda, the official cow of zero-nonsense training.

> 👋 **Hi. I’m Matilda.**  
> Most “training platforms” are three hours of buzzwords followed by a quiz asking what color a button was.  
> TrailForge is different. We keep learning **short, useful, and deeply human.**  
> You’ll like it here. I promise. 🐄

## ✨ What Is TrailForge?

TrailForge is a **lightweight, Salesforce-native learning platform** built for teams that want:

✔ Short, focused lessons  
✔ Meaningful quizzes with training mode  
✔ Progress tracking that isn’t a black box  
✔ Optional **access-code login** for external learners  
✔ A friendly cow mascot who quietly judges corporate fluff  

If your LMS makes people roll their eyes… TrailForge will feel like a breath of fresh barn air.
